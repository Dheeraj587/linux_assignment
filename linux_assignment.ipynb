        "Q1. What is Linux ?\n",
        "ans:Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for a wide range of operating systems, known as Linux distributions.  Linux has grown into a powerful, flexible, and secure system used in everything from personal computers and servers to smartphones, embedded devices, and supercomputers. Unlike proprietary systems, Linux is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute, which has fostered a global community of developers and users.\n",

        "q2.What is the difference between Hard Link & Soft Link ?\n",
        "ans:A hard link is like a duplicate name for the same file on your system. It points directly to the file’s data, so even if the original file is deleted, the data is still there as long as the hard link exists. On the other hand, a soft link ,it points to the original file’s path. If the original file is deleted, the soft link breaks and no longer works. Hard links can't link to directories or files on other file systems, while soft links can. In short, hard links share the same data, while soft links just point to the location of the file.\n",

        "q3. What is a Kernel in Linux?\n",
        "ans: the kernel is the core part of the operating system that acts as a bridge between the hardware and software. It manages system resources such as the CPU, memory, and input/output devices, and ensures that different programs and users can run and interact with the hardware safely and efficiently.\n",
